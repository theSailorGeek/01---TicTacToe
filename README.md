A Simple TicTacToe Game, made during the 100 Days of Code Challenge

Don't blame the design, it's all about functionality at the moment.

Things I learned by programming this:
- Apply JavaScript events to html
- Create and call functions in JavaScript
- Work with constants and variables in JavaScript

Feel free to fork and apply the code.
